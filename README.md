# Quit Smoking Instantly

This method is simple, straightforward, effective, and instant — with no pain or side effects.

It worked for me, a former chain smoker who smoked for nearly 40 years.

## 0. Are You Ready?

Pause!

Ask yourself: *“Do I truly want to quit smoking?”*

> • If the answer is *no*, stop here.
>
> • If it’s **yes**, keep reading.

## 1. Say It Out Loud

Speak to yourself with confidence:

> “**I never smoke.**”

Repeat it at least 3 times or for at least 5 seconds.

Craving or not, say it again.

Always let the words flow from your mouth, reach your ears, and settle in your brain.

## 2. Why It Works

Your subconscious mind doesn’t care about the truth — it always prioritizes what feels familiar.

By using your own voice — which your subconscious finds most familiar — you effectively “**hack**” it. When you tell it, “I never smoke” in your own voice, your subconscious will *automatically* act in line with that identity.

By repeating “I never smoke” often enough, your subconscious will accept it as truth — and beliefs shaped by the subconscious tend to stick.

Compare this with “I want to quit smoking,” which is simply a conscious wish and conflicts with your old subconscious memories:

> • I used to smoke.
>
> • I always smoke.
>
> • I will smoke.

The subconscious always wins when it clashes with your conscious mind.

Say it. Repeat it. Believe it. Simple as that. That’s why this clear statement of identity — “I never smoke” — is so effective.

## 3. Tips for Success

Speak **clearly**, **slowly**, and **loudly** — your subconscious trusts your own voice above all.

Use a longer version if it helps (for it lasts more than *5* seconds):

> “I never smoke. Cigarettes stink. Smoking doesn’t help, and it doesn’t solve any problem.”

Using a third-person form can also be helpful (for it activates *metacognition*):

> “(Your name), you never smoke. Cigarettes stink. Smoking doesn’t help, and it doesn’t solve any problem.”

Adding an emotional tag can also be more effective (for it's stronger for the subconscious):

> “(Your name), you never smoke. Cigarettes stink. Smoking doesn’t help, and it doesn’t solve any problem. Second hand smoking is disgusting.”

Record yourself and save the audio on your phone. Play it back to reinforce the message or to practice without worrying about being overheard.

**Bonus Tip**:

If you’re learning another language, repeat the message in that language. The subconscious won’t resist because there’s no deep-seated memory of smoking in that language — it’ll absorb the new pattern even faster.

Simply by talking to yourself repeatedly, **you’ll never smoke** because your subconscious mind believes “*you never smoke.*”

## 4. You Can Get Rid of Any Bad Habits

It turns out you can use this same method to get rid of almost any bad habit. Just fill in the blank after “I never…” with the habit you want to quit. For example:

> • I never drink alcohol.
>
> • I never drink coffee.
>
> • I never spend time on short videos.
>
> • I never waste time on smartphones.
>
> • I never watch porn.
>
> • …

One of my students even used this technique to free herself from the pain of a broken heart instantly. What she told herself was remarkably simple:

> “I never loved (her former boyfriend’s name).”

By declaring it this way and repeating it, you rewire your subconscious mind to adopt the new identity.
